  abstract  = "Abstract Carabids are a species-rich group (more than 10 000
               species in the Palaearctic region) and are intensively studied,
               inter alia due to their roles as bioindicators and mediators of
               nutrient flows in ecosystems. Numerous aspects of species'
               systematics, distribution, evolutionary biology (and phylogeny)
               and their ecology are well documented for the western
               Palaearctic and large data sets have already been compiled for
               macroecological studies. The online database carabids.org is an
               enhancement of these data sets and holds species classification
               and country level data on species distribution range for over 10
               000 Palaearctic carabid species. Size and dispersal traits (body
               and eye size and hind wing development) are available for almost
               all (over 3400) western Palaearctic carabid species and
               ecological and life-history traits (regarding food and habitat
               preferences as well as time of reproduction and activity) can be
               offered for most Central European (about 1000) species.
               Carabids.org is meant to be a collaborative and interactive
               project offering a variety of research opportunities. Our
               project contributes to the rapid expansion and analysis of
               freely available traits data on species-rich invertebrates,
               which will help to advance our understanding of community
               assembly and functional diversity effects of such taxa across
               large spatial scales. We would very much appreciate data
               contributions from carabidologists, other scientists and

@ARTICLE{Gelman2005-dk,

  author    = "Gelman, Andrew",
  abstract  = "[Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an extremely important method
               in exploratory and confirmatory data analysis. Unfortunately, in
               complex problems (e.g., split-plot designs), it is not always
               easy to set up an appropriate ANOVA. We propose a hierarchical
               analysis that automatically gives the correct ANOVA comparisons
               even in complex scenarios. The inferences for all means and
               variances are performed under a model with a separate batch of
               effects for each row of the ANOVA table. We connect to classical
               ANOVA by working with finite-sample variance components: fixed
               and random effects models are characterized by inferences about
               existing levels of a factor and new levels, respectively. We
               also introduce a new graphical display showing inferences about
               the standard deviations of each batch of effects. We illustrate
               with two examples from our applied data analysis, first
               illustrating the usefulness of our hierarchical computations and
               displays, and second showing how the ideas of ANOVA are helpful
               in understanding a previously fit hierarchical model.]",
